Rules for the game
(as any game it has rules)

1) To ensure that a cell will remain alive in the next time, it must have 2 or 3 living neighbours 
otherwise it dies because overpopulation or loneliness

2) if a dead cell has 3 living neighbours cells, then it comes to the life again as Lazarus or a zombie
